# Learning SpecFlow
This repository is based on a LinkedIn course called **API Testing and Validation**.  
The original course is based on PHP and other libraries that was not appealing to me.  
As C# Developer, I want something based on my programming language world. So, I decided to find an alternative solution. I followed the course but using C# as main programming language and SpecFlow and NUnit as libraries.  
The course is wonderful and I was so happy to find the C# libraries to implemented this on my own.
