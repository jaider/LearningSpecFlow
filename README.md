# LearningSpecFlow
This repository is based on a LinkedIn course called API Testing and Validation. 
The original course is based on PHP and other libraries that was not appealing to me. 
As C# Developer, I want something based on my programming language / world. so I decided to find an alternative solutions. 
I followed the course but using C# as main programming language and SpecFlow and NUnit as libraties. 
The course is wonderful and I was so happy to find the C# libraries to implemented in my own.
